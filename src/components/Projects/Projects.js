              description="In the existing methods industries uses manual checking by different gauges to identify the defects in products.  In this proposed model, image processing method is employed to identify various defects in products. First the images are captured using image sensor for training the dataset. The captured images are classified with different classes and trained using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).  While real time capturing, first the picture of the product is captured and compared with the existing trained dataset.  For testing, gear is employed as a subject material, here we have classified different cases into three as tooth missing, scratched gear and perfect gear. "

In this face recognition, many algorithms are performed to dissect and capture images of someone's face, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this algorithm, the system can recognize a person's face and welcome them by calling there name also record timing of that person so that finding customers activities are more efficient and faster."

MobilenetV2 architecture is used to train a model of image classification to detect peoples in public places and give an awareness of wearing a mask in public.
